# Assessment for A-Cloud Software Engineering :

Your task is to develop an application that facilitates the uploading of CSV file data..
A sample CSV file is provided, with the first line representing headers. It&#39;s important
to note that the field barcode within the CSV file is unique.

The application should feature REST endpoints enabling users to:
1. Update the database with the datasheet(datasheet.csv)
2. Retrieve all data from the database and sort by expiry date.
3. Retrieve data by barcode from the database.

Delete a record by barcode from the database.
Data uploaded via the application should be stored in the database, with the in-memory database table mirroring the fields described in the CSV file.

Please share the link of the repository platform of your choice.

Best of luck, and we hope you enjoy the task!
